# ModernMendel_IntroR

An Introduction to R Studio workshop utilizing simulated data from Mendelian crosses to 
investigate Mendel's Laws of Inheritance using the statistical software of a modern day 
biologist!

Designed for a fourth-year undergraduate quantitative genetics course, this Intro to R Studio
workshop was designed to get students familiar with R Studio before using r/qtl for QTL analysis.
The workshop also asks students questions regarding Mendel's Laws of Inheritance and introduces
a chi-squared test to test for the independent assortment of certain traits following crosses.
